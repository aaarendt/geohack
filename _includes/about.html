                <h2>About Neurohackweek</h2>
                <p>Neurohackweek is a 5-day hands-on workshop in neuroimaging and data science, held at the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">University of Washington eScience Institute</a>. Participants will learn about technologies used to analyze human neuroscience data, and to make analysis and results shareable and reproducible.</p>
                <p>Morning sessions will be devoted to hands-on lectures and afternoon sessions will be devoted to participant-directed activities: hackathon and breakout sessions on topics of interest</p>
                <p>This format is inspired by <a href="http://astrohackweek.github.io/">astrohackweek</a>, a similar program focused on astrophysics.
                </p>

                <h2>Information for applicants</h2>
                <p>To best benefit from the program, participants are expected to have some experience with programming and with neuroimaging data (e.g., analysis of neuroimaging data in scripting languages, such as Python, R, or similar)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Accepted applicants will be asked to pay a fee of $200 upon final registration. This fee will include participation in the course, accommodation in the UW dorms, and two meals a day (breakfast and lunch), for the duration of the course.
