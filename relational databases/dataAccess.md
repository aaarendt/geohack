### Overview

We have set up a PostgreSQL database on the Microsoft Azure cloud with support from the [Azure for Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/azure/default.aspx) program. Here we provide information on how to connect to this cloud database and gain experience querying and building your own tables.
