# GeoHackWeek Planning

* When? Week of August 29, 2016?
* Where? DSS and/or Active Learning Classrooms in Odegaard.
 
### Possible topics (for tutorials or hacking):

* GoogleEarth / Engine
* 3/4/+D Vis (e.g. Worldwide Telescope)
* Machine learning 
* Embarrassingly parallel problems on cloud platform
* GIS tools
* PostgreSQL databases / PostGIS
* Data zoo - datasets for people to explore, try to visualize, etc.
* Remote sensing image analysis
* NCEI data sets and automatic downloads
* Scientific visualization 
* Geostatistics
* LiDAR processing
* route mapping for Urban applications

### Possible Invitees and Instructors (besides us):

* Catherine Kuhn (PhD student, UW): Google Earth Engine
* Ben Hudson (postdoc, APL): Google Earth Engine
* Joe Hamman: Python in geosciences, xarray
* Amanda Tan: API development
* Will Gagne-Maynard: Grad student under Jeff Richie; Meta Proteomics Amazon R etc
* Nick Bolton (PhD student, UW): route mapping for urban applications
* Sophie Clayton (Postdoctoral researcher, UW): oceanography applications
* Emilio Mayorga (APL): Open source GIS / AOOS
* Sean Barberie (JPL): Drones

### Data Zoo: Please enter candidates and sub-bullet potential challenges / data qualifiers

I (Rob) have in mind data that can be comprehended fairly quickly with no misconceptions so that subsequent effort hacking on this data doesn't prove to be wasted time. 

- LiveOcean: 3D time series ocean state includes currents, temp, other parameters
- Match these data to NPZ to fisheries

NPZ = Nutrient Phytoplankton Zooplankton


- Taxi or other vehicle data: Would need to identify; GPS datetime + location
- Seismic
- IRIS tomography seismic velocity
(Down-side is this may prove difficult to comprehend correctly)
- Distribution of earthquakes (from USGS)
- Plate boundaries (primarily Pacific rim) http://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/slab/ 
- Dissolved Organic Matter
- Differentiate molecular formulas by weight and correlate with known structures
- From MS we obtain molecular formulas but not structure; but in many cases we know structure (and therefore formula) for common compounds.
- Problems around marine data
- CTD particularly associated with cruises
- Flow Cytometry
- In situ PCR
- ADCP
- Autonomous vehicles
- Drifters
- Current models
- See also bullet 1 above
