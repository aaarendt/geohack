# GeoHack 2016

The University of Washington's eScience Institute is planning a geoHack Week aimed at expanding our understanding of software tools for the geosciences. 

* When? Monday August 29 to Thursday Sept 1, 2016
* Where? eScience Institute [Data Science Studio](http://escience.washington.edu/wrf-data-science-studio/)
* Who? [Randy LeVeque](http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/), [Rob Fatland](http://www.robfatland.net/research/), [Anthony Arendt](http://www.apl.washington.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Arendt&first_name=Anthony): organizers/instructors. Additional instructors TBD.
* Why? The geosciences is experiencing a rapid expansion in data volume and complexity, but few researchers have the time to learn new methods for handling such data. We can do more, higher quality collaborative science by learning best software practices.
* How? We will combine formal instruction with hackathons on datasets provided by the instructors. Show us how you typically handle data science challenges, and work together with participants to forge new approaches and learn optimized methods.
 

### Possible topics (for tutorials or hacking):

* GoogleEarth / Engine
* 3/4/+D Vis (e.g. Worldwide Telescope)
* Machine learning 
* Embarrassingly parallel problems on cloud platform
* GIS tools
* PostgreSQL databases / PostGIS
* Data zoo - datasets for people to explore, try to visualize, etc.
* Remote sensing image analysis
* NCEI data sets and automatic downloads
* Scientific visualization 
* Geostatistics
* LiDAR processing
* route mapping for Urban applications

Rob: Parker's data, list of 7 different resources nothing to do with Parker. Can we hit those (e.g. ARGO Buoys) and relate them to Parker's stuff? Can you go into Parker's API and find specific patterns in the data? 

Randy: GeoClaw. How do we get a bunch of other data to interface with GeoClaw? We need other software to handle. 

Anthony: 

Talk to Dave Beck:






### Data Zoo: Please enter candidates and sub-bullet potential challenges / data qualifiers

I (Rob) have in mind data that can be comprehended fairly quickly with no misconceptions so that subsequent effort hacking on this data doesn't prove to be wasted time. 

- LiveOcean: 3D time series ocean state includes currents, temp, other parameters
- Match these data to NPZ to fisheries

NPZ = Nutrient Phytoplankton Zooplankton


- Taxi or other vehicle data: Would need to identify; GPS datetime + location
- Seismic
- IRIS tomography seismic velocity
(Down-side is this may prove difficult to comprehend correctly)
- Distribution of earthquakes (from USGS)
- Plate boundaries (primarily Pacific rim) http://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/slab/ 
- Dissolved Organic Matter
- Differentiate molecular formulas by weight and correlate with known structures
- From MS we obtain molecular formulas but not structure; but in many cases we know structure (and therefore formula) for common compounds.
- Problems around marine data
- CTD particularly associated with cruises
- Flow Cytometry
- In situ PCR
- ADCP
- Autonomous vehicles
- Drifters
- Current models
- See also bullet 1 above
